# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This is a location to record all high-level architecture decisions in the MaxMQ.

An Architectural Decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a
functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant.
An Architecturally Significant Requirement (ASR) is a requirement that has a
measurable effect on a software systemâ€™s architecture and quality.
An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) captures a single AD, such as often done
when writing personal notes or meeting minutes; the collection of ADRs created
and maintained in a project constitute its decision log. All these are within
the topic of Architectural Knowledge Management (AKM).

## Rationale

ADRs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new feature designs
and new processes, for collecting community input on an issue, and for
documenting the design decisions.

The ADR provides the context, intuition, reasoning, and justification for a
change in architecture, or for the architecture of something new. If recorded
decisions turned out to be lacking, convene a discussion, record the new
decisions here, and then modify the code to match.

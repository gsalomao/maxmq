| [MQTT-1.5.3-1]             | The character data in a UTF-8 encoded string MUST be well-formed UTF-8 as defined by the Unicode specification [Unicode] and restated in RFC 3629 [RFC3629]. In particular this data MUST NOT include encodings of code points between U+D800 and U+DFFF. If a Server or Client receives a Control Packet containing ill-formed UTF-8 it MUST close the Network Connection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [MQTT-1.5.3-2]             | A UTF-8 encoded string MUST NOT include an encoding of the null character U+0000.

For SUBSCRIBE or UNSUBSCRIBE it is the corresponding SUBACK or UNSUBACK.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

MUST NOT re-send the PUBLISH once it has sent the corresponding PUBREL packet. |
| [MQTT-4.3.3-2]             | In the QoS 2 delivery protocol, the Receiver  MUST respond with a PUBREC containing the Packet Identifier from the incoming PUBLISH Packet, having accepted ownership of the Application Message. Until it has received the corresponding PUBREL packet, the Receiver MUST acknowledge any subsequent PUBLISH packet with the same Packet Identifier by sending a PUBREC. It MUST NOT cause duplicate messages to be delivered to any onward recipients in this case. MUST respond to a PUBREL packet by sending a PUBCOMP packet containing the same Packet Identifier as the PUBREL. After it has sent a PUBCOMP, the receiver MUST treat any subsequent PUBLISH packet that contains that Packet Identifier as being a new publication.                                                       |
